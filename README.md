# DSM Automation Test Suite

Test suite for DSM frontend using pytest-selenium. It generates reports in allure and HTML format.

### *Dependencies*
* Docker Engine 
  - Minimum RAM: 8 GB; Recommended: 16 GB.
  - Minimum Disk Space: ~3GB.

### *Steps for running tests in docker container*
The docker image has the browsers and other dependencies installed.

1. Clone repository
```commandline
git clone git@github.com:fortanix/dsm-automation-test-suite.git
```

2. Build docker image 
```commandline
cd dsm-automation-test-suite
docker build . -t dsmqa
```

3. Run tests
```commandline
docker run -v `pwd`/reports:/app/reports dsmqa -m smoke --URL $URL --EMAIL $EMAIL --PASSWORD $PASSWORD --ACCOUNT_ID $ACCOUNT_ID --BROWSER=$BROWSER --CLEANUP
```
Optionally, `â€“add-host [Hostname]:[IPAddress]` option can be passed to add host-entries onto /etc/hosts when the container is run.
The execution reports will be stored in reports directory once the execution is completed.

**NOTE**: On passing option `--CLEANUP`, the existing account data will be deleted and test will begin with a clean account. All the previous security objects, groups, apps, plugins would be removed.

**Test Arguments:**

```
-m              Pytest marker to run tests. e.g: smoke, apps, dashboard, groups, security_objects

--URL	        URL endpoint to be used for running tests. e.g: https://amer.smartkey.io/

--EMAIL         Email ID to be used for logging in

--PASSWORD      Password to be used for logging in

--ACCOUNT_ID    Account ID to be used for test operations. Account ID can be copied from DSM UI > Select account > Settings > Click Copy account id icon.

--BROWSER       Optional argument to run tests with different browsers. e.g: Chrome(default), Firefox, Edge

--BROWSER_MODE  Optional argument to run test in head/headless mode. e.g: headless(default, only runs headless in docker), head

--CLEANUP       Pass the option to clean up the previous data in the account.  
```

### *Result and Reporting*
Once the test execution is completed, the reports will be generated in the reports directory. 
1. HTML report: HTML is generated in reports directory with naming convention as index_*.html
2. Allure report: Allure report is generated in the reports directory and can be viewed by running the command `allure serve reports` from the project root directory. This requires allure cli to be installed on the host machine. Allure cli can be installed from pip package `allure-pytest` or from https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/releases
